-Node js : js runtime, built on google's open source V8 js engine.
-html,css,js,react,angular - all execute on browsers.
-If we execute js outside of browser to overcome the disadvantages(accessing file system, better networking) of running it on browser, then its node.js
-node.js is env where the js code executes, who parses and executes - V8 js engine

-when to use node.js :
-API with DB(preferably noSql)
-data streaming(youtube)
-real time chat apps
-server side web app

-when to not use node.js:
-apps with heavy server side processing(instead use php,python,ruby)
-video conversions,image conversions, file compression

-why :
to build highly scalable and fast applications
single threaded, event driven, non-blocking I/O

-node documentation : noedejs.org

- to use pre define modules, get them into your current file Ex : const fs=require('fs');

-synchronous(blocking) : executes one line after another in sequence
-asynchronous(non-blocking) code : use async functions like readFile, which uses a callback fn
that is executed once the file is done reading the contents(readFile fn)
-why use async - nodejs uses single thread, if sync is used, requested by a single user, all other
users need to wait until the first user is served which is not efficient way
-callback hell : when the first fn execution depends on the execution of second and so on
Ex : fs.readFile(start.txt,(err,data1=>{
fs.readFile(start2.txt,(err,data2=>{
fs.readFile(start3.txt,(err=>{
console.log("done");}))
}))
}))

-what is an web API - service from which we can request some data
-every file in node.js is a module
-npm : contains all 3rd party packages that can be used in our apps
-npm init : asks few questions and based on the answers creates package.json file

-nodemon : dev dependency, automatically load files on changes without needing restart server
npm i nodemon --save

-globally install packages to make them available across the entire machine
sudo npm i nodemon --global

const slugify=require('slugify')
can be converted from localhost:3000/product?id=0 to localhost:3000/fresh-avocados

npm outdated - gives the list of outdated packages
